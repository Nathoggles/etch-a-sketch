# Etch a sketch webapp

View the working project in [Github Pages](https://nathoggles.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)


A simple etch-a-sketch web app, made on my own from a short brief assignment (see below) on The Odin Project.
I used the project to further hone my JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Git skills.
I particularly aimed to make the webapp look nice on both PCs/tablets and mobile.
